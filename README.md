# Timer-Trek

A Star Trek themed timer.
JavaScript under the hood, CSS to make it looks like the LCARS (Library Computer Access and Retrieval System).

This started as a code challenge in programming bootcamp to make a timer with JavaScript.
Extra credit was given for making it flash or play a sound when the timer was up.
So I thought to myself... "I know what else flashes and plays a sound!"

Many thanks to http://www.lcarscom.net/ for inspiration and resources.

Live long and prosper.
